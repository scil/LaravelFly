LaravelFly runs Laravel much faster, and make Tinker to be used online(use tinker while Laravel is responding requests from browsers).

Thanks to [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src) and [PsySh](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh)

## Quick Start

1.`pecl install swoole`   
Make sure `extension=swoole.so` in config file for php cli.   
LaravelFly Mode Map requires swoole 4.0.  
Suggest: `pecl install inotify`   

2.`composer require "scil/laravel-fly":"dev-master"`

3.`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=fly-app`   
This is publishing an app config file 

4.`php vendor/scil/laravel-fly/bin/fly start`   
If you enable `eval(tinker())` and see an error about mkdir, please start LaravelFly using sudo.

Now, your project is flying and listening to port 9501. Enjoy yourself.

Every time LaravelFly starts, it makes a config cache file `laravelfly_ps_map.php` or `laravelfly_ps_simple.php` located `bootstrap/cache`, you can run  
`php artisan config:clear && php vendor/scil/laravel-fly/bin/fly start`   
if config file `config/laravelfly.php` changed frequently.

## Speed Test

### A simple ab test 

 `ab -k -n 1000 -c 10 http://zc.test/green `

.   | fpm |  Fly Mode Simple | Fly Mode Map
------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Requests per second   | 3 |  5  | 34
Time taken ≈ | 325 | 195  | 30
  50%  | 2538|   167  | 126
  80%  |   3213|  383   | 187
  99%   | 38584| 33720  | 3903

<summary>Test Env</summary>

* A visit to http://zc.test/green relates to 5 Models and 5 db query.
* env:   
ubuntu 16.04 on virtualbox ( 2 CPU: i5-2450M 2.50GHz ; Memory: 1G  )  
php7.1 + opcache + 5 workers for both fpm and laravelfly ( phpfpm : pm=static  pm.max_children=5)

## LaravelFly Usability 

It can be installed on your existing projects without affecting nginx/apache server, that's to say, you can run LaravelFly server and nginx/apache server simultaneously to run the same laravel project.

The nginx conf [swoole_fallback_to_phpfpm.conf](config/swoole_fallback_to_phpfpm.conf) allow you use LaravelFlyServer as the primary server, and the phpfpm as a backup server which will be passed requests when the LaravelFlyServer is unavailable. .

Another nginx conf [use_swoole_or_fpm_depending_on_clients](config/use_swoole_or_fpm_depending_on_clients.conf) allows us use query string `?useserver=<swoole|fpm|...` to select the server between swoole or fpm. That's wonderful for test, such as to use eval(tinker()) as a online debugger for your fpm-supported projects.


## Todo

- [x] add events
- [x] aliases cache in ResolveSomeFacadeAliases
- [x] add log cache
- [x] watch code changes and hot reload
- [x] watch maintenance mode using swoole_event_add
- [x] mysql coroutine
- [ ] handle php config and laravel config like Zend in Mode Simple?
- [ ] handle php config and laravel config in Mode Map?
- [ ] add tests about auth SessionGuard: Illuminate/Auth/SessionGuard.php with uses Request::createFromGlobals
- [ ] add tests about uploaded file, related symfony/http-foundation files: File/UploadedFile.php  and FileBag.php(fixPhpFilesArray)
- [ ] mysql connection pool
- [ ] websocket
- [ ] send file
- [ ] travis, static analyze like phan, phpstan or https://github.com/exakat/php-static-analysis-tools
- [ ] decrease worker ready time
- [ ] cache fly

## Similar projects that mix swoole and laravel

* [laravoole](https://github.com/garveen/laravoole) : wonderful with many merits which LaravelFly will study. Caution: laravoole loads the app before any request ([onWorkerStart->parent::prepareKernel](https://github.com/garveen/laravoole/blob/master/src/Wrapper/Swoole.php)),  but it ignores data pollution, so please do not use any service which may change during a request, do not write any code that may change Laravel app or app('event') during a request, such as registering event .
